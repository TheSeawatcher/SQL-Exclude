# SQL-Exclude
SQL Exclude this is a function to be able to get all data but the column name

This code is used in a wordpress plugin but you should be able to apply this principle to all sites.

This is a very slow function in comparason to just writting out lots of column names
This function is best used on multiple tables with large numbers of columns for it to be at it's most efficent
